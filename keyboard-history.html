        <h1>Complete History of Keyboard Evolution</h1>
        
        <p>The keyboard's evolution spans over 250 years, beginning with early typing devices in the 1700s and culminating in today's advanced mechanical, membrane, and virtual keyboards. From the invention of the typewriter to the QWERTY layout, teletypes, and modern computer interfaces, keyboards have remained the most essential input tool for human-computer interaction.</p>

        <div class="fact-box">
            <h3>📜 Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>The QWERTY layout was invented in 1868 not for speed, but to prevent mechanical typewriters from jamming! It remains the world standard 150+ years later.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Early Beginnings (1700s–1800s)</h2>
        
        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-year">1714</div>
                <h3>First Typing Device Patent</h3>
                <p>Henry Mill patented a machine resembling a typewriter, though it was never manufactured. This marked the first recorded attempt at a mechanical writing device.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-year">Mid-1800s</div>
                <h3>Experimental Innovations</h3>
                <p>Various inventors experimented with mechanical writing machines, but most were impractical for everyday use due to complexity and cost.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-year">1868</div>
                <h3>The QWERTY Revolution</h3>
                <p>Christopher Latham Sholes invented the first practical typewriter, introducing the QWERTY layout to reduce jamming by spacing out commonly used letter pairs. This layout remains dominant worldwide.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Typewriter Era (1870s–1930s)</h2>
        
        <h3>Commercial Success</h3>
        <p>The Remington Company mass-produced Sholes' typewriter in 1873, making typing accessible to businesses and revolutionizing office work worldwide.</p>
        
        <h3>Blind Typing Challenges</h3>
        <p>Early machines printed characters out of sight, only visible after the page was removed. This led to the development of visible typewriters in the 1890s.</p>
        
        <h3>Standardization</h3>
        <p>By the early 20th century, typewriters became office staples, with QWERTY firmly established as the global standard despite more efficient alternatives.</p>

        <h2>Transition to Teletypes and Computing (1930s–1960s)</h2>
        
        <div class="innovation-list">
            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Teletype Machines</h3>
                <p>Combined typewriter-like keyboards with communication systems, allowing typed messages to be transmitted over wires and telegraph lines.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Video Display Terminals (VDTs)</h3>
                <p>Introduced in the 1960s, these paired keyboards with screens, paving the way for modern computing and real-time text display.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>ASCII Standard (1963)</h3>
                <p>Provided a universal code for characters, enabling consistent keyboard-to-computer communication across different systems.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Rise of Computer Keyboards (1970s–1990s)</h2>
        
        <h3>Early Computer Keyboards</h3>
        <p>Adapted from typewriters but connected electronically to computers, featuring additional function keys and numeric keypads.</p>
        
        <h3>Membrane Keyboards (1980s)</h3>
        <p>Cheaper and quieter than mechanical ones, though less tactile. Became standard for home computers and office use.</p>
        
        <h3>IBM Model M (1984)</h3>
        <p>Famous for its "buckling spring" mechanism, offering durability and tactile feedback. It remains iconic among enthusiasts and collectors today.</p>
        
        <h3>Function Keys & Arrow Keys</h3>
        <p>Expanded usability beyond typing, supporting navigation, shortcuts, and specialized software operations.</p>
